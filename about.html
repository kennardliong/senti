      <h2>How Our Sentiment Analysis Works</h2>
      <p>
        Our sentiment analysis tool combines information to get the most accurate and up-to-date analysis.
      </p>

      <ol class="workflow">
        <li>
          <strong>Gathering Reddit Data:</strong> We collect 50 recent posts from Reddit related to your search term to gauge public opinion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analyzing Reddit Post Titles:</strong> We analyse the titles of recent posts, using TF-IDF vectorizer (to account for relevance), stop word removal (filtering meaningless words), and exclude neutral scores (to reduce noise) to refine the analysis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>LLM-Based Analysis (Gemini):</strong> We also use Gemini to consider historical significance, recent events, and public perception from both social and corporate standpoints.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Combining Scores:</strong> The final sentiment score is a weighted average of the Reddit-based model's score and the LLM-based score. By default, we give each component equal weight (50/50).
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Coca-Cola:</strong> Score ≈ 55. Despite its popularity, there are considerations to factor in like health concerns from its sugary composition.
      </div>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>NVIDIA:</strong> Score ≈ 62. A major player in graphics and AI, generally viewed favorably, but subject to market volatility and supply chain concerns.

      <h2>Uncertainty and Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        Sentiment analysis is inherently uncertain. Public sentiment changes over time due to news events, social trends, and other factors. Our tool provides a snapshot of sentiment based on recent data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, our model is not perfect. Sentiment is nuanced. We do our best to provide results that reflect the real world, but it isn't always certain.
